### Requirements
- The widget displays the following information:
  - list of options for users to vote on.
  - The latest number of votes for each option. This is only shown after the user has submitted a vote.
- The following back end APIs are provided:
  - Fetching of the poll results.
  - Record a new vote on an existing poll option.
  - Remove a vote from an existing poll option.
- It should not require much effort for a website owner to embed a poll widget within their websites.

Thanks to Shiki, highlighting is done at build time. No JavaScript is sent to the client for runtime highlighting.

## Example

```ts showLineNumbers title="next.config.js" {3} /appDir: true/
import { withContentlayer } from "next-contentlayer"

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  images: {
    domains: ["avatars.githubusercontent.com"],
  },
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ["@prisma/client"],
  },
}

export default withContentlayer(nextConfig)
```
